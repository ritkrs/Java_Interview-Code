What are the states of the objects in Hibernate:-
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
** There are 3 states of object(instance)in hibernate:-
** 1. Transient:-  The object is in a transient state if it is just created but has no primary key(identifier)
                   and not associated with a session.
** 2. Persistent:- The object is in a persistent state if a session is open,and you just saved the instance				  
				   in the database or retrieved the instance from the database.
** 3. Detached:-   The object is in a deteached state if a session is closed.After deteached state,the object
                   comes to persistent state if we will call lock() or update().
