** CACHE:-It is used for the improve the performance.
(1)  FIRST LEVEL CACHE:-
     (i)  Session object holds the first level cache.
	 (ii) It is enabled by default.
	 (iii)In this case,data is not available into thhe entire application.
     (iv) An application can use many session object.

(2)  SECOND LEVEL CACHE:-
     (i)  Session factory holds the 2nd level cache data.
     (ii) The data stored in 2nd level cache will be available into entire application.
     (iii)We need to enable 2nd level cache explicitly.
     (iv) Hibernate 2nd level cache uses common cache for all session object of a session factory.
     (v)  It is useful if We have multiple session objects from a session factory.
