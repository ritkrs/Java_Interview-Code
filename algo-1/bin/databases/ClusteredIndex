** Index:-
_________________
* Indexes are used to retrieve data from the database more quickly than otherwise. The users cannot see the indexes, 
  they are just used to speed up searches/queries.

** Clustered index:-
_________________________
* The clustered index is used to reorder the physical order of the table and search based on the key values.
  Each table can have only one clustered index.
  
  
  ** Non-Clustered index:-
__________________________
* The reason to create non clustered index is searching the data.We will know that clustered indexes are
  created automatically primary keys are generated,bot non-clustered indexes are created when multiple
  joins conditions and various filters are used in the query.
