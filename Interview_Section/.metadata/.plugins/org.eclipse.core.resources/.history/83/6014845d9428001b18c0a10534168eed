** EXCEPTION:- (CHECKED EXCEPTION):-

** ClassNotFoundException:-Java.lang ClassNotFoundException is thrown when the J.V.M tries to load a particular
                           class and then specified class not found in class path.It is checked exception
						   must be declared with method or class.
   Soln 1:- Verify the name of requested class is correct and that appropriate .jar file exists in 
            our class path.If not,explicitly add to our app classpath.
   Soln 2:- In case of specified .jar file exists in our classpath then,our app classpath is getting
            overridden and we must find exact classpath used by our application.

** SqlException:-An exception that provides information on a database access error or other errors.	
   Soln:-   Load JDBC driver,create a connection to the db,catch sql ex.

** I/O Execption:-Java i/o exceptions are input/output exceptions,and they occur whenever an i/p or o/p is
               failed or interpreted. For ex:- If we ae trying to read file and file does not exists,then
			   we will get this error.

** FileNotFoundException:-A file with specified pathname does not exist.
                          A file with specified pathname does exist but inaccessible for same reason(required
						  writing or reading of that file,don't allowing accessing the file).
   Soln:-Create a file:-Reading a optional configuration file,not finding it and creating a new one with 
                          default values.
					**  Handle by try or catch or throws keyboard.

** CloneNotException:- In a class,We performed cloning but in class we didn't implemented cloneable interface.

** ParseException:- It is checked exception.
                 ** It occurs when fail to parse a String that is ought to have a special format.
                 ** When we are trying to parse String to date obj.And as we know String should have specified format.
				 ** If given String is doesn't meet the format java.text.parseException will be thrown.
				 
				    E.g 1:- String dateStr="2011-11-19";
					DateFormat df=new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-mm-dd");
					O/P:- Sat Nov 19:00:0000  EEt 2020
					
					E.g 2:- String dateStr="2011 11 19";
					O/P:- Parse exception in this case
					
** EXCEPTION:- Runtime:-(EXCEPTION UNCHECKED):-
______________________________________________
** AirthmeticException:-If any no is divided by zero then we will get this exception.

** NullPointerException:-It is the child class of RuntimeException and hence it is unchecked.Raised
                          automatically by JVM,whenever we are trying to call any method on null.

** NoFormatException:-It is the child class of IllegalArgumentException and hence it is unchecked.Raised
                      explicitly by the programmer to indicate that we are attempting to convert String to no.
                      But String is not properly formatted.E.g:- int j=Integer.parseInt("ten");

** ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException:-It is the child class of RuntimeException and hence it is unchecked.Raised
                                  automatically by the JVM whenever we are trying to access array element
								  without or range index.
								  E.g:- int[] x=new int[10];
								        s.o.p(x[100]);  //ArrayOutOfBoundException.
										
** ClassCastException:- It is the child class of RuntimeException and hence it is unchecked.Automatically
                        by the JVM whenever we are trying to typecast parent obj to child type.
						 E.g:- Object o=new Object();
						       String s=(String)o;
