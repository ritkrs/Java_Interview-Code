(1) Fail-Fast:- (1)These iterators throw ConcurrentModificationException if a collection modified while 
    iterating over it.
	(2) Fail-Fast use original collection to traverse the elements of the collection.
	(3) These iterator don't require extra memory.
        E.g:- Iterators returned by ArrayList,Vector,HashMap.

(2) Fail-safe:-(1)Fail safe iterator allow modifications of a collection while iterating over it.
    (2)In case of fail safe iterators don't throw any exception if a Collection is modified while
        iterating over it.
    (3)They use copy of original collection to traverse over the elements of collection.
    (4)These iterators require extra memory for cloning of collection.
       E.g:- ConcurrentHashMap,CopyOnWrite ArrayList.
