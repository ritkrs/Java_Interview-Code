(1) TRY WITH RESOURCES:-Until 1.6 version try should be associated with either catch or either finally block.but
  * From 1.7 onwards we can only take try without catch and finally.
  * Once the control reached at end,whatever resources are their that will get closed automatically.
  
(2) MULTI-CATCH BLOCK:-Until 1.6 version we used to take multiple catch block for multiple type exceptions.
  * But from 1.7 onwards we can take only one catch block for handle the multiple type of exceptions.
     E.g:-catch(Ae/IOException).
	 
(3) EXCEPTION PROPGATION:-	Inside a method if an any exception is raised and we are not handling those exception
    then the exception object will be propagated to caller method then the caller method is responsible 
    for handle those exception.

** Difference between errors and Exceptions:-
 * ERRORS:-(i) An error will occur due to a lack of system resources.
   (ii)It is not possible to recover from an error.
   (iii) Errors occur at run-time and are not known by the compiler.
   
 * EXCEPTION:-(i) Exceptions are caused by the code of the application itself.  
   (ii)The use of try-catch blocks can handle exceptions and recover the application from them.
   (iii)Exceptions can be “checked” or “unchecked,” meaning they may or may not be caught by the compiler.
