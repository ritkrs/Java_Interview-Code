** PRODUCER AND CONSUMER PROBLEM:-
 
 * Producer(producer Thread) will produce the items to the queue and consumer(consumer thread) will consume
   the items from the queue. If the queue is empty then consumer has to call wait() method on the queue object 
   then it will entered into waiting state.
   
 * After producing the items producer Thread call notify() method on the queue to give notification
    so that consumer Thread will get that notification and consume items.
