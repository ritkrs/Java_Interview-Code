** BEHAVIORAL:- Observer Design Pattern(Dependents or Publish-Subscribe)
_______________________________________________________________________________
** Just define One-to-One dependency so that one object states changes,all other dpendents get notified 
    and updated automatically. 
** This pattern is also known as Dependents or Publish-Subscribe pattern.	


** Advantage:-
_______________________________________________________________________________
** It provides loosely coupling between objects and the observer.


** Loosely Coupling:-One interface reference variable can hold different types of implementation class memories.
                         E.g:-(GSM Mobile):-Any network sim is loosely coupled with the handset.
					 
** Tightly Coupling:- One interface referance variable can hold only one types of implementation class memories.
                          E.g:-(CDMA Mobile):-Reliance sim is tightly coupled with that CDMA mobile set.     					 


** Where to use Observer Design Pattern?	
______________________________________________
** We can use Observer design pattern anywhere while developing any social media platform.
** Suppose that if a person updated his status on Twitter,then the other people who is following
     that person get notified and they are able to see his status.
** A follower can follow or unfollow a person at any time.
** After unfollow the person is no longer to get the notifications in future.
