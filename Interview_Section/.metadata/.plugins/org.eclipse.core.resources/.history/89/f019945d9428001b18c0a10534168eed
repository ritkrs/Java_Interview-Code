(1)   TREESET:-(1)The underlying data structure is balanced tree. 
      (2) Duplicate objects are not allowed.
	  (3) Insertion order is not preserved and it is based on some sorting order of objects.
	  (4) Heterogeneous objects are not allowed if we are trying to insert heterogeneous objects then we will get ClassCastException. 
	  (5) Null insertion is possible(only once). 
	  
(2)  NULL ACCEPETANCE:-(1)For the empty TreeSet as the 1st element “null” insertion is possible but 
     after inserting that null if we are trying to insert any other we will get NullPointerException.
    (2)For the non empty TreeSet if we are trying to insert null then we will get NullPointerException. 

(3) EXTRA:-(1)If we are depending on default natural sorting order compulsory the objects 
         should be homogeneous and Comparable otherwise we will get ClassCastException.
   (2)An object is said to be Comparable if and only if the corresponding class implements Comparable interface. 
   (3)String class and all wrapper classes implements Comparable interface but StringBuffer class doesn’t 
      implement Comparable interface hence in the above program we are getting ClassCastException.
