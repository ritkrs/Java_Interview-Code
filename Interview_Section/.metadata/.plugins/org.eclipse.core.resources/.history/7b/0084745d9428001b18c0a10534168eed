** HASHMAP-JAVA8-CHANGES:-(i)As We know that,In case of hash collision objects are stored as node in linked list
   and equals methods are used to compare the keys.
   (ii)  To find a correct key in linked list is a linear operation.
   (iii) So in worst case scenerio the complexity will be O(n).
   (iv)  To overcome this problem hash elements used BALANCED TREES instead of linked list after certain
         threshold is reached.
		 
		 It means:-I can say in other words
		 
   (v)  Hashmap starts with sorting entry objects in linked list but after number of items in a hash becomes
        larger than a certain threshold.
  (vi)  The Hash will change from using a linked list to a balanced tre,which will improve the worst case
        performance from O(n) to O(log n).
