(1)  OVERLOADING:-Two methods are said to be overload if and only if both having the same name but different argument types.
 
     CASES:-(i) Automatic promotion in overloading. 
	 
	 (ii) In overloading Child will always get high priority then Parent. 
	       E.g:-Test t=new Test();
		   t.methodOne("bhaskar");//String version   
		   t.methodOne(new Object());//Object version   
		   t.methodOne(null);//String version 
		   
	(iii) In general var-arg method will get less priority that is if no other method matched then only var-arg 
	      method will get chance for execution it is almost same as default case inside switch.
		  
     (iv) In overloading method resolution is always based on reference type based on runtime object 
        	and runtime object wonâ€™t play any role in overloading.
