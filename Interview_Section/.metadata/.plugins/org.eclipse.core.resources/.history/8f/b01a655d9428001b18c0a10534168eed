** Serialization:- The Process of writing state of an object to a file is Serialization
   * But it is the process of converting an object from java supported  form into either file supported form
     or network supported form.
   * By using fileOutputStream and ObjectOutputStream We can achieve the Serialization.
        
   * D-Serialization:-The process of reading state of an object from the file is called D-Serialization.
   * But it is the process of converting an object from either file supported form or network supported form into
     java supported form.
   * By using FileInputStream and ObjectOutputStream classes we can implement D-Serialization.
   
   NOTE:- We can serialize only serializable objects and object is said to be serializable if and only if the
          corresponding class implements serializable interface.
        * Serilizable interface is present in java i.o package and it doesn't contain any methods.It is marker 
		  interface. If we are trying to serialize a non serializable object then wewill get run time
		  exception saying NotSerilizableException.
		  E.g:-
		        public class Dog implements Serializable {
	              int i=10;
	              int j=20;
                }
				public class SerilizeDemo {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{
		Dog d1=new Dog();
		//Serialization
		FileOutputStream fos=new FileOutputStream("abc.ser");
		ObjectOutputStream oos=new ObjectOutputStream(fos);
		oos.writeObject(d1);
		
		//D-Serialization
		FileInputStream fis=new FileInputStream("abc.ser");
		ObjectInputStream ois=new ObjectInputStream(fis);
		Dog d2=(Dog)ois.readObject();
		System.out.println(d2.i+" "+d2.j);
		
	}
