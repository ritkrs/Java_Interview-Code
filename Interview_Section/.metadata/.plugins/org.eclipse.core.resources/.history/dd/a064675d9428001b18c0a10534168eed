(1) PRIORITY-QUEUE:-
   (1) We can use PriorityQueue to represent a group of individual objects prior to processing according to
       some priority. 
   (2) The priority order can be either default natural sorting order (or) customized sorting order 
       specified by Comparator object.
   (3) If we are depending on default natural sorting order then the objects must be homogeneous and Comparable
       otherwise we will get ClassCastException.
   (4) If we are defining our own customized sorting order by Comparator then the objects need not be
       homogeneous and Comparable.
   (5) Duplicate objects are not allowed.
   (6) Insertion order is not preserved but all objects will be inserted according to some priority. 
   (7) Null is not allowed even as the 1st element for empty PriorityQueue.
