** CHECKED :-The exceptions which are checked by the compiler for smooth execution of the program 
   at runtime are called checked exceptions.(E.g:-FileNotFoundException ).
   
 * UNCHECKED:-The exceptions which are not checked by the compiler are called unchecked exceptions. 
               E.g:-ArithmeticException, NullPointerException.
			   
   NOTE:-RuntimeException and its child classes, Error and its child classes are unchecked 
         and all the remaining are considered as checked exceptions.
		 
   NOTE:- Whether exception is checked or unchecked compulsory it should occur at runtime only there is
              no chance of occurring any exception at compile time.

** TRY:- We can incorporate any no of exceptions in try block.But all exception inside try block only.
 * Whatever variable we will declare inside try that is used inside try block only.(local to try).
 * If we will not incorporate any exceptions inside try then try block will be not execute.
 * If we will declare any global variable that can be used by try and catch both.
 * One try can have any no of catch.
 * We can't keep any statement between try and catch block.

** CATCH:- If any exception is rised befor try then catch is not responsible to handle that exception.
 * If any error occur inside try that can be handle by another try and catch block.
 * If any exception raised inside try and that can be not handle by catch,then flow will be terminate.
 * Two catch shouldn't the same arguement.
 * Between two catch we can't keep any statement.

** FINALLY:- If once ctrl will enter inside try block then anyhow finally block will be execute.
 * We will keep any no finally block after all catches.
 * We can't keep any statement between try and catch block.
