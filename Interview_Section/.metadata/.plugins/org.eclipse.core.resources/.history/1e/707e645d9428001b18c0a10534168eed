** Externialization:-The main advantage of Externialization over Serialization is everything takes care by
	   programmer and J.V.M doesn't have any control. Based on the requirement we can save either total object
	   or part of the object,which improves performance of the system.  
	   
     * To perform Externialization,compolsory the corresponding class should implement externilizable interface.
     * Externilazable interface define two methods.	(1)writeExternal()  (2)readExternal. 
	 * Externilazable interface is the child interface of Serializable.
	 
	 * (1)public void writeExternal(ObjectOutput out)throws IOException:-This method will be executed automatically
	   at the time of serialization.This method is used write the code to save required variables to the file.
	   
	 * (2)public void readExternal(ObjectInput in)throws IOException,ClassNotFoundException:-This method 
	   will be executed automatically at the time of D-serialization.This method is used to write code to read
	   read required variables from the file and assign to current object.
	   
	 * But,Strictly speaking at the time of D-serialization,J.V.M will create a separate new object by executing
	   public no argue constructor on that object J.V.M will call readExternal.
	 * Hence,Every Externilazable implemented class should compulsory contain public no argue constructor,
       otherwise we will get Runtime exception saying InvalidClassException.	 
	   
** Difference between Serialization and Externialization:-
** Serialization:-
(1)   It is meant for default serialization.
(ii)  Hence,Everything takes care by J.V.M and programmer doesn't have any control.
(iii) Serialization allows possible to save total object to the file and it is not possible to save part of the object.
(iv)  Relatively performance is low.
(v)   It is the best choice if we want to save the total object to the file.
(vi)  Serializable interface doesn't contain any methos and it is marker interface.
(vii) Serilizable implemented class not reuired to contain public no argue constructor.
(viii)Transient keyboard will play role in Serialization.

** Externialization:-
(i)   It is meant for customized serialization.
(ii)  Here,Everything takes care by programmer & J.V.M doesn't have any control.
(iii) Based on our requirement We ca save either total object or part of the object.
(iv)  Relatively performance is high.
(v)   It is the best choice if we want to save part of the object to the file.
(vi)  Externilazable interface contain two methods (i)writeExternal  (ii)readExternal.
(vii) Externilazable implemented class should compolsory contain public no a constructor.otherwise we will get RuntimeException.
(viii)Transient keyboardwon't play any role.
