(1) THROW STATEMENT: Sometime we can create exception object explicitly and we can hand over to the JVM
      manually by using throw keyword. 
 * In general we can use throw keyword for customized exceptions but not for predefined exceptions.
 * After throw statement we can’t take any statement directly otherwise we will get compile time error with unreachable statement.  
 * We can use throw keyword only for Throwable types otherwise we will get compile time 
      error saying incomputable types. 
	    
(2) THROWS STATEMENT:-In our program if there is any chance of  raising checked exception compulsory
          we should handle either by try catch or by throws keyword otherwise the code won’t compile.  
  * Hence the main objective of “throws” keyword is to delicate the responsibility of exception handling
     to the caller method. 
  * “throws” keyword required only checked exceptions. Usage of throws for unchecked exception there is no use. 
  * “throws” keyword required only to convenes complier. Usage of throws keyword doesn’t prevent abnormal termination of the program. 
  * we can use throws keyword only for Throwable types otherwise we will get compile time error saying incompatible types
  * In our program if there is no chance of rising an exception then we can’t  right catch block for that exception otherwise we will get compile time error saying exception.
  
(3) FINAL:- If a class declared as the final then child class creation is not possible. 
  * If a method declared as the final then overriding of that method is not possible. 
  * If a variable declared as the final then reassignment is not possible. 
  
(4) FINALLY:-It is block and we used this with try,catch and finally block.
  * It is mainaly used for code clean up purpose.

(5) FINALIZE:-It is a method which should be called by garbage collector always just before 
               destroying an object to perform cleanup activities.   
** NOTE:- To maintain clean up code finally block is recommended over finalize() method because 
            we can’t expert exact behavior of GC.
