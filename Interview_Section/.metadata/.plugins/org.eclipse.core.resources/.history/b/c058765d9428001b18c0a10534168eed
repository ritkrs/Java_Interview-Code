****Predicates****
_________________________________
  ** A predicate is a function with a single argument and returns boolean value.
  ** To implement predicate functions in Java, Oracle people introduced Predicate  interface in 1.8 version (i.e.,Predicate<T>).
  ** Predicate interface present in Java.util.function package.
  ** It’s a functional interface and it contains only one method i.e., test().
  ** As predicate is a functional interface and hence it can refers lambda expression.
  ** It’s possible to join predicates into a single predicate by using the following methods:-
      and()
      or()
      negate()	  
           these are exactly same as logical AND ,OR complement operators.
