1)CHARAT(int index);
 Returns the character locating at specified index.
2)CONCAT(String str);
 The overloaded “+” and “+=” operators also meant for concatenation purpose only.
3)EQUALS(Object o);
 For content compression where case is important.
 It is the overriding version of Object class .equals() method.
4)EQUALSIGNORECASE(String s);

6)SUBSTRING(int begin, int end);
 Returns the substring from begin index to end-1 index.
7)LENGTH();
 Returns the no of characters present in the string.

 To replace every old character with a new character.
9)TRIM()
 We can use this method to remove blank spaces present at beginning and end of the
   string but not blank spaces present at middle of the String.
12)INDEXOF(char ch);
 It returns index of 1st occurrence of the specified character if the specified
  character is not available then return -1.

 Note:
 Because runtime operation if there is a change in content with those changes a new object will be created only on the heap but not in SCP.
 If there is no change in content no new object will be created the same object will be reused.
