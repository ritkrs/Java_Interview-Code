(1) CHECKED:-(i)Compiler have info about checked exception
    (ii) Compiler will force us to keep try,catch or throws ehenever it is required.
	(iii)If try and catch not required and programmer keep try and catch,then its compile time error.
	
(2) UNCHECKED:- Compiler doesn't have any  information about unchecked exception.
    (ii) Compiler will not force to us keep try and catch block in the program.
    (iii)Unchecked exception is error type or run type.

(3) THROWS:-(i)Java throw keyboard is used explicitly throw an exception.
    (ii) Throw is followed by instance.
    (iii)We can't throw multiple exception.
    (iv) It is used to create exception object manually.

(4) THROWS:-(i)Java throws keyboard isused to declare an exception.
     (ii) Throws is followed by class.
     (iii)But We can throws multiple exceptions.
     (iv) It is used to handle checked exceptions.
	 
(5) EXCEPTION:-(i)  Most of the cases exceptions are caused by our program and these are recoverable  
   (ii)The use of try-catch blocks can handle exceptions and recover the application from them.
   (iii)Exceptions can be “checked” or “unchecked,” meaning they may or may not be caught by the compiler.   	 
	 
(6) ERRORS:-(i)Most of the cases errors are not caused by our program these are due to lack of system resources and these are non recoverable.
   (ii)It is not possible to recover from an error.
   (iii) Errors occur at run-time and are not known by the compiler.
