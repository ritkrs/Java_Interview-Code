(1)  OVERRIDING W.R.T STATIC VARIABLES:-(i) We can’t override a static method as non static. 
     (ii)Similarly we can’t override a non static method as static.
	 (iii)We can override static to static and it's look like overriding but it is known as method hiding.
	 
** DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OVERRIDING AND METHOD HIDING:-

   OVERRIDING:-
   (i)  Both Parent and Child class methods should be non static. 
   (ii) Method resolution is always takes care by JVM based on runtime object. 
   (iii)Overriding is also considered as runtime polymorphism (or) dynamic polymorphism (or) late binding.
   
   METHOD HIDING:-
   (i)  Both Parent and Child class methods should be static.
   (ii) Method resolution is always takes care by compiler based on reference type. 
   (iii)Method hiding is also considered as compile time polymorphism (or) static polymorphism (or) early biding.
   
   VAR-ARG:-A var arg method should be overridden with var-arg method only. If we are trying to override 
            with normal method then it will become overloading but not overriding. 
			
   OVERRIDING VARIABLES:(1)Overriding concept is not applicable for variables. 
   (ii) Variable resolution is always takes care by compiler based on reference type. 

   NOTE:-In the above program Parent and Child class variables, whether both are static or non static
          whether one is static and the other one is non static there is no change in the answer.
