1)  WEAK-HASHMAP:-(i)It is exactly same as HashMap except the following differences. 
     (ii) In the case of normal HashMap, an object is not eligible for GC even though it doesn’t
          have any references if it is associated with HashMap. That is HashMap dominates garbage collector. 
	 (iii)But in the case of WeakHashMap if an object does not have any references then it’s always eligible
	      for GC even though it is associated with WeakHashMap that is garbage collector dominates WeakHashMap.
