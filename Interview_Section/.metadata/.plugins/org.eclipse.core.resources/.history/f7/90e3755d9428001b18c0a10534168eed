(1)  PERMGEN:-(i)PermGen (Permanent Generation) is a special heap space separated from the main memory heap.
     (ii) JVM Contains here:-Static content, primitive variables.
	 
(2)  METASPACE:-(1)it has replaced the older PermGen memory space.
     (2)Garbage collector now automatically triggers the cleaning of the dead classes once the class 
	     metadata usage reaches its maximum metaspace size.
		 with this improvement, JVM reduces the chance to get the OutOfMemory error.
