(1) DATA HIDING:- Our internal data should not go out directly that is outside person canâ€™t access our 
                 internal data directly.
				 
 * IMPLEMENTATION:-By using private modifier we can implement data hiding. 
   EXAMPLE:-       After providing proper userName and password we can able acess our gmailinbox information.
 * ADVANTAGE:-     The main advantage of data hiding is security.

(2) ABSTRACTION:-Hide internal implementation and just highlight the set of services, is called abstraction.
 
 * IMPLEMENTATION:-By using abstract classes and interfaces we can implement abstraction.
 * EXAMPLE:-       By using ATM GUI screen bank people are highlighting the set of services
                   what they are offering without highlighting internal implementation
 * ADVANTAGE:-We can achieve security as we are not high lighting our internal implementation.
            * Enhancement will become very easy because without effecting end user we can able to perform any type of changes in our internal system
            * It provides more flexibility to the end user to use system very easily. 
            * It improves maintainability of the application. 

(3)ENCAPSULATION:It is the process of Encapsulating data and corresponding methods into a single module. 

 * IMPLEMENTATION:-If any java class follows data hiding and abstraction such type of class is said to be encapsulated class. 
 			     * In encapsulated class we have to maintain getter and setter methods for every data member.
 * EXAMPLE:-Suppose We have an bank account and that bank account variables are public,then anyone can
     see the balance of that bank account.That's why its declare private.
	 The person who can this account,they have access of only private members through method defined inside class.				 
 * ADVANTAGE:-We can achieve security.
            * Enhancement will become very easy. 
            * It improves maintainability of the application.
            * It provides flexibility to the user to use system very easily. 

 * DISADVANTAGE:-The main disadvantage of encapsulation is it increases length of the code and slows down execution. 

 * TIGHTLY ENCAPSULATED CLASS:If the parent class is not tightly encapsulated then no child class is tightly encapsulated.
