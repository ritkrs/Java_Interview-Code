(1) HASHMAP:-(1)It is a thread safe.
    (ii)  Relatively performance is high because Threads are not required to wait to operate on Hashmap.
	(iii) While one Thread iterating Hashmap the other Threads are not allowed to modify Map objects otherwise
	      We will get Runtime Exception saying ConcurrentModificationException.
	(iv)  Iterator of HashMap is fail-fast and it throws ConcurrentModificationException.
    (v)	  Null is not allowed for both keys and values.
	(vi)  Introduced in 1.2 version.

(1) CONCURRENT-HASHMAP:-(1)We will get thread safety without locking total map object just with bucket level lock.
    (ii) At a time multiple threads are allowed to operate map object in safe way.
	(iii)Read operation can be performed without lock but write operation can be performed with bucket level lock.
    (iv) While one thread iterating map object,the other threads are allowed to modify map and We won't get
         concurrent modification exception.
     (v) Null is not allowed for both keys and values
     (vi)Introduced in 1.5 version.

(2) SYNCHRONIZED MAP:-(1)We will get thread safety by locking whole map object.
    (ii) At at a time only one thread is allowed to perform any operation on Map object.
	(iii)Every read and write operations require total Map object lock.
	(iv) While one threaditerating Map object,yhe other Threads are not allowed to Modify Map otherwise We will
	     get ConcurrentModificationException.
	(v)  Nullis allowed for both keys and values.
    (v1) Introduced in 1. version.
