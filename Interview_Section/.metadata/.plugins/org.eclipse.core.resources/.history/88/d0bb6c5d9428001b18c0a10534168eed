** NOTIFY() VS NOTIFYALL():-

 * NOTIFY():-
_______________

 * We can use notify() method to give notification for only one Thread. If multiple Threads are waiting then
   only one Thread will get the chance and remaining Threads has to wait for further notification. But which
   Thread will be notify(inform) we canâ€™t expect exactly it depends on JVM. 
   
 * NOTIFYALL():-
____________________

 * We can use notifyAll() method to give the notification for all waiting Threads. All waiting Threads
     will be notified and will be executed one by one.
	 
 * NOTE: On which object we are calling wait(), notify() and notifyAll() methods that corresponding 
           object lock we have to get but not other object locks
