** IMMUTABLE:-
 
 * Declare the class as final so it can'y be extended.
 * Make all fields private so that direct access is noy allowed.
 * Don't provide setter methods for variables.
 * Make all mutable fields final so that its value can be assigned only once.
 * Initialize all the fields via a constructor performing deep copy.
 * We Will perform cloning of objects in the getter methods to return a copyreather than returning
        the actual object reference.
		
		
** FINAL vs IMMUTABILITY:	

 * If we declare a variable as final then we can’t perform reassignment for that variable.
 * It doesn’t mean in the corresponding object we can’t perform any changes.
 * That is through final keyword we won’t get any immutability that is final and immutability concepts are different.
