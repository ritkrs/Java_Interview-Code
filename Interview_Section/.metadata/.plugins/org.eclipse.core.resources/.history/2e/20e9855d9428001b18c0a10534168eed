**   RUNNABLE AND CALLABLE DIFFERENCE:-

(1)  RUNNABLE:-
_____________________

(i)If a Thread is not required to return anything after completing the job.Then We should go for Runnable interace.
(ii) Runnable interface contains only run() method.
(iii)Runnable job not required to return anything and hence return type of run() method is void.
(iv) Within the run() if there is any chance of rising checked exception,Compulsory we should handle by using
     try catch because we can't use throws keyboard for run() method.
(v)  Runnable interface present in java.lang package.	 


(2)  CALLABLE:-
______________________

(i)If a Thread required to return something after completing the job then we should go for callable.
(ii) Callable interface contains only one methods that is call() method.
(iii)Callable job is required to to return something hence return method of call() method is object.
(iv) Inside call method if there is any chance of rising checked exception,We are not required to handle
     by using try,catch because call() already throws exception.
(v)  Callable interface present in Java.util.Concurrent package.
