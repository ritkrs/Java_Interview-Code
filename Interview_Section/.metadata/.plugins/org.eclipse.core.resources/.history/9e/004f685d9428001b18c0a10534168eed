(1)  IS-A-RELATIONSHIP(INHERITANCE):-By using extends keywords we can implement IS-A relationship.

 *   ADVANTAGE:- code reusability. 
 
(2)  HAS-A-RELATIONSHIP:-HAS-A relationship is also known as composition(or)aggregation.(Used for code reusability).
    
 *   There is no specific keyword to implement hAS-A relationship but mostly we can use new operator. 
 *   Class Car HAS-A engine reference.(Engine e=new Engine();)
 
(3)  COMPOSITION:Without existing container object if there is no chance of existing contained objects
     then the relationship between container object and contained object is called composition which
  	 is a strong association.   

(4)COMPOSITION:- public class Car {
    //final will make sure engine is initialized
    private final Engine engine;     
    public Car(){
       engine  = new Engine();
   }
   }
class Engine {
    private String type;
} 

NOTE:-Engine is-part-of Car, the relationship between them is Composition.

(5) AGGREGATION:-public class Organization {
    private List employees;
}

public class Person {
    private String name;   
}
NOTE:-Since Organization has Person as employees, the relationship between them is Aggregation.
