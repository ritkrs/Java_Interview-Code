(1)  COPY-ON-WRITE-ARRAYLIST:-(i)It is thread version of Arraylist.
     (ii)CopyOnWriteArrayList creates a cloned copy of underlying Arraylist for every update operation at certain
	 point both will synchronized automatically which is taken care by J.V.M internally.
	 
(2)  COPY-ON-WRITE-ARRAYSET:-(i)It is thread version of set.
     (ii) Internally implement by copyOnWriteArrayList.
     (iii)Multiple Threads are able to perform Read operation simultaneously but for every update operation
          a seperate cloned copy will be created.
      (iv)As for every update operation a seperate cloned copy will be created which is costly.
      (v) Hence,If multiple update operation are required then it is not recommended to use copyOnWriteArraySet.
      (vi)While one Thread iterating set the other Threads are allowed to Modify set and We won't get
           ConcurrentModificationException.
