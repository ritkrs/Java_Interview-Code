** SQL INJECTION ATTACK:-
______________________________
**  SQL injection is a code injection technique that might destroy your database.
 *  It is one of the most common web hacking techniques.
    E.g:- Sql injection usually occurs when we ask a user for input like their userName/userId and
	instead of a name/id then user gives us a sql statement that we will UNKNOWNINGLY run on our database.
	
	Live Eg:-txtUserId = getRequestString("UserId");
             txtSQL = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = " + txtUserId;
			 
			 
		*******SQL Injection Based on 1=1 is Always True******
		________________________________________________________
**	The original purpose of the above code was to create an SQL statement to select a user, with a given user id.
 *  If there is nothing to prevent a user from entering "wrong" input, the user can enter some "smart" input like this:
	E.g: - SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = 105 OR 1=1;	
	
** 	The SQL above is valid and will return ALL rows from the "Users" table, since OR 1=1 is always TRUE.
**  Does the example above look dangerous? What if the "Users" table contains names and passwords?
**  The sql statement like this:-
        SELECT UserId, Name, Password FROM Users WHERE UserId = 105 or 1=1;
		
		
		NOTE:- A hacker might get access to all the user names and passwords in a database, by simply inserting
		105 OR 1=1 into the input field.
